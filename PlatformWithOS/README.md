#  E-Ink Driver for: Raspberry Pi / BeagleBone Black

# Driver Programs - Directory "driver-common"

* gpio_test - simple test for GPIO driver
* epd_test - test program for direct driving EPD panel
* epd_fuse - present EPD as a file for easy control


## Extra item for BeagleBone

The program uses device tree files to access the GPIOs, so
Install the necessary firware files from: https://github.com/nomel/beaglebone

~~~~~
git clone https://github.com/nomel/beaglebone.git
cp -p beaglebone/gpio-header/generated/gpio-P9.* /lib/firmware
~~~~~

Note: There is a README-BeagleBoneBlack.md that you should also read
as it explains the update of the Angstomsystem on the SD Car in more
detail.


## Compiling

These test programs should compile with no additional libraries, but
the EPD driver needs the fuse development library installed.

~~~~~
# Raspberry Pi
sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev
# BeagleBone Black
sudo opkg install libfuse-dev
~~~~~

### GPIO Test

Connect three LEDs each with a limiting resistor (1k..2k); the
resistor connects from an expansion connector pin to the anode of an
LED.  Two of the LEDs will flash and the third will brighten and dim.

Pin connections

LED          R Pi    B B B    Description
-----------  ------  -------  --------------------------
LED_BLUE     P1_23   P9_15    Flashes on/off
LED_WHITE    P1_21   P9_23    Fashes  off/on
LED_PWM      P1_12   P9_14    Brightens and dims


Build and run using (within gratis toplevel directory):

~~~~~
make rpi-gpio_test  # bb-gpio_test
sudo PlatformWithOS/driver-common/gpio_test
~~~~~


### EPD Test

This will first clear the panel then display a series of images (all
2.0" images from Arduino example).  This need the Linux SPI module
installed.

#### Raspberry Pi: Build and run using:

~~~~~
##sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708 ## deprecated SPI driver
sudo modprobe spi-bcm2835
ls -l /dev/spi*    ### if no SPI devices present see note below
make rpi-epd_test
sudo PlatformWithOS/driver-common/epd_test
~~~~~

Note: on some version of the image the SPI may be disabled: check the
file `/boot/config.txt` for the line:

~~~~~
dtparam=spi=on
~~~~~

If this was commented out then remove the comment `#` character, save
the file and reboot. Now the SPI devices should show up after the modprobe
above:


#### BeagleBone Black: Build and run using:

~~~~~
make bb-epd_test
sudo PlatformWithOS/driver-common/epd_test
~~~~~


### EPD fuse

This allows the display to be represented as a virtual director of files, which are:

File         Read/Write   Description
--------     -----------  ---------------------------------
version      Read Only    The driver version number
panel        Read Only    String describing the panel and giving its pixel width and height
current      Read Only    Binary image that  matches the currently displayed image (big endian)
display      Read Write   Image being assembled for next display (big endian)
temperature  Read Write   Set this to the current temperature in Celsius
f_stage_time Read Write   Set stage time in milliseconds for 'F' command
command      Write Only   Execute display operation
BE           Directory    Big endian version of current and display
LE           Directory    Little endian version of current and display

Command   Byte   Description
--------  -----  --------------------------------
'C'       0x43   Clear the EPD, set `current` to all zeros, `display` is not affected
'U'       0x5A   Erase `current` from EPD, output `display` to EPD, copy display to `current`
'P'       0x50   Do partial update of display by only updating the changed parts
'F'       0x46   Same as partial update, but use user defined stage time

Notes:

* The default bit ordering for the display is big endian i.e. the top left pixel is
  the value 0x80 in the first byte.
* The `BE` directory is the same as the root `current` and `display`.
* The `LE` directory `current` and `display` reference the top left pixel as 0x01
  in the first byte.
* The `current_inverse` and `display_inverse` represent black as zero (0) and white as one (1)
  while those item without the suffix represent the display's natural coding (0=>white, 1=>black)
* The particular combination of `BE/display_inverse` is used in the Python EPD demo
  since it fits better with the Imaging library used.


Build and run using:

~~~~~
make rpi-epd_fuse          # bb-epd_fuse
sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708  # not on BeagleBone Black (note below)
sudo mkdir /tmp/epd
sudo PlatformWithOS/driver-common/epd_fuse --panel=2.0 -o allow_other -o default_permissions /tmp/epd
cat /tmp/epd/version
cat /tmp/epd/panel
echo C > /tmp/epd/command
PlatformWithOS/driver-common/xbm2bin < cat_2_0.xbm > /tmp/epd/display
echo U > /tmp/epd/command
# try displaying other images
# to shut down:
sudo umount -f /tmp/fuse
rmdir /tmp/fuse
~~~~~

Note: On the BeagleBone firmware is loaded to enable the SPI


# Starting EPD FUSE at Boot

Need to install the startup script in `/etc/init.d` and install the
EPD FUSE program in /usr/sbin, there is a make target that does this.

~~~~~
sudo make rpi-install   # bb-install
sudo service epd-fuse start
ls -l /dev/epd
# to stop
sudo service epd-fuse stop
# to remove
sudo make remove
~~~~~


# Python Demo Programs - directory "demo"

These need the PIL library installed:

~~~~~
# Raspberry Pi
sudo apt-get install python-imaging
# BeagleBone Black
sudo opkg install python-imaging
~~~~~


## Drawing Demo

Draw some lines, graphics and text

~~~~~
python PlatformWithOS/demo/DrawDemo.py
~~~~~


## Image demo

* Accepts a lists of image files on the command line.
* Converts them to grey scale to ensure formats like PNG, JPEG and GIF will work.
* Inverts the image since the E-Ink panel is reverse (i.e. black on white).
* Converts image to single bit (PIL "1" mode).
* Display the middle of the image (using crop function).
* Delay.
* Display the re-sized image.
* Delay before fetching next file.


Note if scratch is installed on the system, the following commands will
show some cartoon animals.  The images when re-sized will be distorted
if the aspect ration of the original image is not the same as the
display.

python PlatformWithOS/demo/ImageDemo.py /usr/share/scratch/Media/Costumes/Animals/cat*
python PlatformWithOS/demo/ImageDemo.py /usr/share/scratch/Media/Costumes/Animals/d*.png

## Twitter Demo

Setup easy_install and use it to get pip, then use pip to get tweepy.
Copy the sample configuration an edit to include your authentication
information.  Rather than using the basic authentication it is better
to set up a Twitter App and generate a token for this.  The token
generation is quick at
[https://dev.twitter.com/](https://dev.twitter.com/).  After creating
the App,just click the button to create an access token.

Use *Ctrl-C* to stop this program.

~~~~~
# Raspberry Pi
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install pip
~~~~~

~~~~~
# BeagleBone Black
opkg install python-pip python-setuptools
~~~~~

~~~~~
# All
sudo pip install tweepy
# setup the config
cp tweepy_auth.py-SAMPLE tweepy_auth.py
# *** edit the config
# run the demo (this watches for linux)
python PlatformWithOS/demo/TwitterDemo.py linux
~~~~~


## Partial Demo

Display random overlapping rectangles using partial update.  First
argument is number of rectangle to generate before updating the EPD,
second number is the number of frames to display before the program
exits.

~~~~~
python PlatformWithOS/demo/PartialDemo.py 3 20
~~~~~


## Counter Demo

Display a 4 digit hex counter uses partial update to only change the
updated digits.  This will look somewhat strange as the display inversion
will make the counter appear to go through a sequence like:
0000 0001 0000 0001 ...delay... 0001 0002 0001 0002

Use *Ctrl-C* to stop this program.
