# Precautions

1. The EPD Panel / Module is manufactured from fragile materials
such as glass and plastic, and may be broken or cracked if dropped.
Please handle with care. Do not apply force such as bending or twisting
to the EPD panel during assembly.

1. It is recommended to assemble or install EPD panels in a clean
working area. Dust and oil may cause electrical shorts or degrade the
protection sheet film.

1. Do not apply pressure to the EPD panel in order to prevent
damaging it.

1. Do not connect or disconnect the interface connector while the
EPD panel is in operation.

1. Please support the bezel with your finger while connecting the
interface cable such as the FPC.

1. Do not stack the EPD panels / Modules.

1. Do not press the FPC on the glass edge or Pull FPC up / down
to 90°.

1. Do not touch the FPC lead connector.

1. Wear a Wrist Strap (Grounding connect) when handling and
during assembly. Semiconductor devices are included in the EPD Panel /
Module and they should be handled with care to prevent any electrostatic
discharge (ESD). (An Ion Fan may be needed in assembly operation to
reduce ESD risk.)

1. Keep the EPD Panel / Module in the specified environment and
original packing boxes when storage in order to avoid scratching.

1. Do not disassemble or reassemble the EPD panel.

1. Use a soft dry cloth without chemicals for cleaning. The surface
of the protection sheet film is very soft and easily scratched.

1. Be mindful of moisture to avoid its penetration into the EPD
panel, which may cause damage during operation.

1. High temperature, high humidity, sunlight or fluorescent light
may degrade the EPD panel’s performance. Please do not expose the
unprotected EPD panel to high temperature, high humidity, sunlight, or
fluorescent for long periods of time. It is highly recommended to store
the EPD panel in a dark place without condensation, a temperature range
of 15ºC to 35ºC, and humidity from 30%RH to 60%RH.

1. The ink used for marking the Panel ID number is erased easily by
solvent. Please avoid using solvent to clean the EPD panel.

1. The EPD is vacuum packed.

1. Before approved by PDI and customer, products and product
specifications may be subject to change without notice. Confirm that you
have received the latest product standards or specifications before
final design, purchase or use.

1. PDI makes every attempt to ensure that its products are of high
quality and reliability. However, contact PDI sales office before using
the product in an application that demands especially high quality and
reliability or where its failure or malfunction may directly threaten
human life or cause risk of bodily injury, such as aerospace,
aeronautics, nuclear power, combustion control, transportation, traffic,
safety equipment or medical equipment for life support.

1. Design your application so that the product is used within the
ranges guaranteed by PDI particularly for maximum rating, operating
supply voltage range, heat radiation characteristics, installation
conditions and other characteristics. PDI bears no responsibility for
failure or damage when used beyond the guaranteed ranges. Even within
the guaranteed ranges, consider normally foreseeable failure rates or
failure modes in semiconductor devices and employ systemic measures such
as fail safes, so that the equipment incorporating PDI product does not
cause bodily injury, fire or other consequential damage due to operation
of the PDI product.

1. This product is not designed to be radiation resistant.
